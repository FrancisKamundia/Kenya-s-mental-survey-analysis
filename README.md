Applying Machine Learning Algorithms and USSD to Diagnose Mental Illness in Kenya

INTRODUCTION

Overview of the topic.
The World Health Organization characterizes mental health disorders by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perception, emotions, behavior and relationships with others in the society. Mental health disorders include the following conditions, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses dementia and developmental disorders including autism (World Health Organization (WHO), 2019). The prevalence of mental health disorders among individuals has affected many regardless of geographical location, employment status, religion or sex. These mental health disorders have affected individuals to the extent of some attempting suicide with a good number of them succeeding in comiting the act. Governments and non governmental organizations have initiated steps towards trying to curb the prevalence of mental health disorders in the general population, some of these steps include setting up rehabilitation centers to combat drug and substance abuse.

The application of modern technology such as artificial intelligence which is part of machine learning has also helped ease the effects of the mental health disorders in both the patients and health care providers. Despite mental health disorders being the 5th largest disease burden globally and it being in the top three disease burdens in most countries in the world (Datoni et al, 2021) its awareness is still low among the world population especially in low income countries.

Relevant news or research articles.
Major depression being one of the most common mental illnesses in the world has led to some serious effects in individuals, the New York Times has concluded that, globally symptoms of anxiety and depression doubled during the pandemic. For example between the period of 2011-2015 in the united states emergency room visits related to depression, anxiety and similar conditions increased by 28 percent.

Suicide being the fourth leading cause of death among 14-19 year old's globally has an estimated 700,000 people attempting it yearly for every successful suicide attempt there are many more attempting it this is according to the WHO, 2021. WHO has also noted that 77% of suicide deaths occur in low and middle income countries, the link between suicide and mental disorders has been established with other causes being personal crisis such as financial crisis and relationship breakups.

W.H.O has noted that due to new technologies that were unimaginable a decade ago, increasing pressure for cost efficiencies and higher productivity. The extent and pace of change can however when coupled with a working environment that take accounts of peoples mental health being can lead to physical and mental disorders, harmful use of alcohol and other substance. The W.H.O estimates that depression and anxiety being two of the most common mental health disorders cost the global economy an estimated 1 trillion U.S dollars yearly.

MOTIVATION

Individuals suffering from mental health disorders for long have been ignored and these has led to some unexpected occurrences, these include:

(WHO, 2021) has suggested that more than 700,000 people die from suicide every year, it has also pointed out that for every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15- to 19-year-old individuals. This has been associated with mental health disorders, it has been established that individuals who suffer from depression and those that indulge in drug and substance abuse are more likely to attempt suicide which is the strongest risk factor.

Labelling of individuals suffering from mental health disorders in Kenya as ‘mad people’ has led to most of them suffering from stigma. This has also increased the depression rates among them especially those individuals already suffering from diseases such as the HIV/AIDS. According to the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC), HIV stigma and discrimination affect the emotional well being and mental health of people living with HIV. American psychiatry association has pointed out that more than half of the people with mental health illnesses don’t receive help for their disorders this is because they delay seeking treatment due to concerns that they will be treated differently or the fear of losing their job and livelihood.

With the above factors stated and the fact that I have met individuals suffering from mental health disorders both friends and family who were in distress with the need for immediate medical assistance but no way of accessing it, I have decided to conduct this study to find a way of detecting individuals with mental health diseases at earlier stages.

OBJECTIVES

The need to increase mental health awareness especially in the workplace and the general population is of great importance this is due to the fact that more than 10% of the world population experience mental health disorders while only 44% of the world population has some knowledge about mental health disorders. Increasing mental health awareness is key to solving disorders related to mental health, hence we will be looking to increase mental health awareness through our study.

The stigma associated with people identified from society especially in low income countries such as Kenya where some of the individuals experiencing these disorders might be branded as mad men since they lack the necessary mental health services to help them overcome these illnesses. Reducing stigma in individuals experiencing disorders through identification of variables that may lead to an individual experiencing mental health disorders will be key.

OVERVIEW OF FINDINGS

The research and statistics done on mental health awareness in the past have proven to be useful in trying to predict future trends regarding mental health in the global population. Some of these useful findings that I have found are;

Mental health disorders are directly related to suicide cases globally, 60% of suicide cases are caused by individuals with a history of major depressive disorders (WHO, 2021). 77% occur in middle and low income countries disapproving the fact that suicide is done in high income countries. WHO has suggested that about 700,000 people commit suicide annually with there being more suicide attempts for each successful suicide case.

Mental health disorders are more common in women than men, although men and women experience mental health and substance use disorders most illnesses classified under such as anxiety disorders, major depressive disorders and eating disorders are more common in women than men, but substance use disorders such as addiction are more common in men this is according to data available on institute of health metrics and evaluation (IHME).

b) Research questions.
Population and sampling method.
We will use simple random sampling in our study this will be through following the following steps so as to achieve it.

We will define our target population that is Kenyans between the ages of 18 to 50 years old this is so because this age group are the most affected by cases of mental health disorders and they make up 60% percent of the population (Aron O’Neill, 2021). From the target population stated above we will choose a simple random sample of n samples. This is number is dependent on our budget and the time that is allocated for the study.

Simple random sampling method was chosen because of its simplicity and prevents the researcher from displaying bias. Though its simple to conduct it is time consuming and we will be anticipating difficulty in accessing the full list of the population.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

Mental health awareness being the first step to be fulfilled in fighting mental health disorders will be key, so as to help individuals identify if they have mental health diseases, we will first need to educate them about mental health disorders in general. The first question to our research rises from here and we will need to answer it, What is the level of mental health awareness in Kenya?

Application of machine learning in also treating and predicting diseases also presents itself in other forms such as the detection of melanoma using deep learning models such as the convolutional neuro network (CNN) models (Nay chi Lyn et al, 2017). With proper data collection methods, the creation of models that can predict the occurrence of mental disorders in individuals also occurs if it is possible. Hence the question of how can unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) be applied in low-income countries like Kenya be used to ease data collection in low-income countries?

Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders, (saloni dattani et al, 2021) have found out that globally about 792 million people have mental disorders this is about 1 in every ten people suffer from mental disorders, among these those suffering with major depressive disorders are 280 million. The question of how severe is depression in individuals between the age of 18 to 50 years in low-income countries arises?

It is undeniable to say that the effects of mental health disorders have been felt by everyone even in the workplace. Both employers and employees have suffered from the effects of mental health diseases, with some of the factors that contribute to both parties suffering is a toxic working environment. Hence the question of what steps have been taken in the workplace to ensure that mental health is of importance?

c) Domain concepts.
Mental health – mental health includes our emotional psychological and social well-being. It determines how we handle stress relate to others and make choices (mental health, 2020)

Machine learning – is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so (Wikipedia).

Mental health wellness – (Gina Marie Guarino, 2021) has suggested that mental health wellness is the awareness of one’s own ability to cope with stressors of day-to-day life while maintaining the ability to function effectively when socializing working learning and taking care of personal health and hygiene.

Mental health disorder – during the era of Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders IV (DSM-IV) the definition of mental disorder was clinically significant behavioral or psychological or biological syndromes that are associated with present distress disability or significant impairment in the important areas of functioning.

DATA SOURCES

a) Survey methodology.
So as to collect our survey data we followed the following survey methodology:

Selecting sample - Since our target population that was between the age of 18 to 50 years old we selected a sample size for our study by From the target population stated above we will choose a simple random sample of n samples. This is number is dependent on our budget and the time that is allocated for the study. Simple random sampling method was used because of its simplicity that prevents the researcher from displaying bias. Though its simple to conduct it is time consuming and we will be anticipating difficulty in accessing the full list of the population.
Research designs -The research design that was applied was the Cross sectional study here a sample was chosen from the relevant population A cross-sectional study described characteristics of our population at one time, but could not give any insight as to the causes the population characteristics because it is a predictive, correlational design.
Questionnaires - We then developed a questionnaire that was to filled out by respondents in our sample the questionnaire included the following questions:
  - What age bracket do you fall into?
  - What is your gender?
  - Are you a Kenyan citizen?
  - Which county do you live in?
  - Do you live within a town area or outcasts?
  - What is the highest level of education you have completed?
  - What would describe your occupation?
  - How would you describe your income level?
  - How would you describe your social life?
  - Do you have any caring responsibilities?
  - How far is the nearest hospital facility from where you live?
  - How well are you vast with mental health issues?
  - Have you ever accessed any mental health services?
  - Are you aware of any mental health facility within a radius of 10km from your place of living?
  - If you are to access a mental health service / facility, what would be the main reason?
 
Data collection - The data for our survey was collected using the JISC online survey and the link to the survey was sent to the our sample population.

b) External data.
Data location.
The publicly obtained data was obtained from the Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) an non governmental institution that is dedicated to fight the harmful stigma around mental health. The data can be found here, however the data we used here was for the whole years combined since the OSMI mental health in tech survey were introduced.

DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY

The method that was used to collect the data was by use of an online survey on their website the survey for this year (2022) is still running and open and anyone can participate in it the location of the survey is here. OSMI conducts survey mental health survey focusing in the tech industry yearly as from the year 2014.

ETHICAL ISSUES

The ethical issues surrounding the collection and usage of mental health data is of great concern since health data is sensitive data the collection of the data especially the structuring of the questions has to be neatly done so as not to trigger the respondents emotions in any way. This was taken into consideration when collecting the OSMI data by structuring the most of the questions to be open ended so to avoid the questions looking like they were attacking the respondent. The identity of the respondents was also protected by labelling the respondents with unique ids that could not identify the respondents personally.
